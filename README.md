This is a repository for my data analysis work at TopGolf 

The r scripts are numbered by version as I make and update them. I wanted to have an organized way to see my analysis and keep track of changes I make.  
The logic behind the number is for each minor change to the code, such as changing the plot aesthetics, the number increases in the decimal place.  Thus 1.0 is the first script, each minor change thereafter is 1.1, 1.2, 1.3...  For major changes made the decimal is set to 0 and the number in the one's place is increased.  So, if the last script was 1.5 and there is a major change the new version number is 2.0.

I collect and clean the data that I use in this analysis. The data is sensitive and to protect the intellectual property, technology, and other non-public information it will not be distributed.
